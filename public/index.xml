And like many risks of a similar kind, the impacts are greater on the already vulnerable members of society, further widening their vulnerability to other risks (existing and new). As governments embark on recovery efforts to the devastating impacts of COVID-19, it is important that such efforts build upon and contribute to resilience-building to climate change.</description>
