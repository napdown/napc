What we are trying to get to is an interactive table with buttons that allow you to perform the following actions:

Copy to clipboard
Export to CSV
Export to Excel
Export to PDF
Print

```{r 01}
library(leaflet)
library(widgetframe)
l <- leaflet(height=300) %>% addTiles() %>% setView(0,0,1)
frameWidget(l)
```


```{r 02}
library(dygraphs)
ts <- dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures",
              height=250, width='95%')
frameWidget(ts)
```

```{r 03}
dt <-  datatable(
  head(iris, 20), 
  options = list(
     columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = 5)),
     pageLength = 5, lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 15, 20)),
  fillContainer = T)

frameWidget(dt, height = 350, width = '95%')
```
