> There are many avenues for technical guidance and advice on the NAPs. Below are some frequently asked questions.

### 1. How do we submit a NAP for inclusion on NAP Central?

Send the document via E-mail (in pdf or Word format) with a cover email from the National Climate Change Focal Point, to the secretariat (secretariat at unfccc.int; or to any of the offers in the NAP Unit at napcentral at unfccc.int). Your submission will be promptly acknowledged. If you do not hear from us within two days, please contact us in case your E-mail did not go through.


### 2. What are the main guidelines for preparing a NAP?


### 3. Is it possible to get feedback on a draft NAP?


### 4. How do sectoral and sub-national adaptation plans relate to the National Adaptation Plan (NAP)?


### 5. We are currently implementing the GCF NAP Readiness Project, and that will go on for a few years, can we submit our first NAP now?
