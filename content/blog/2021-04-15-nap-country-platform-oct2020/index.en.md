> **NAP Country Platform presentation of country National Adaptation Plans**

Time: 17:00 - 18:30

Organized as part of the NAP Expos, the NAP Country Platform provides a space for developing countries to present their National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to highlight their adaptation priorities and how they will design implementation. They also share the main lessons learned from their work, how they may promote collaboration with other countries, and how they would monitor progress and effectiveness of their adaptation efforts. The first NAP Country Platform was held during the 2019 NAP Expo. Details are available at this link http://napexpo.org/2019/sessions/parallel-session-9-1.
As at 1 October 2020, 20 developing countries had submitted their NAPs on NAP Central. Six countries, namely Grenada, Guatemala, Paraguay, Uruguay, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname submitted their NAPs between April 2019 and October 2020.
