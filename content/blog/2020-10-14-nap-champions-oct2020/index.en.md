> **NAP Champions Webinar: Advancing adaptation through National Adaptation Plans**

Time: 14:00 - 15:30

The event discussed the importance of having a plan to guide concrete action on adaptation and subsequent monitoring and evaluation; and shared specific experience with advanced data systems in supporting systematic observation and monitoring in the important area of food systems. An interactive discussion focused on how to achieve effective plans in a timely manner by relying on best available data and making use of frontier technologies.

The event was part of the NAP Champions Webinar Series designed to advance NAPs at the highest levels of leadership while promoting the NAP as the central vehicle to addressing climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and risks at the national level.

Ms. Loren Legarda, Congresswoman and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines, a NAP Champion, spoke about the importance of having a plan to drive progress in adaptation. The plans should include clear goals and targeted actions, accompanied by systematic collection and analysis of relevant data to understand and act on climate risk. Dr. Catherine Nakalembe, an award-winning scientist, and the recipient of the 2020 Africa Food Prize, delivered a keynote talk on applying earth observation data in building regional and global approaches to national solutions, putting a spotlight on the GEOGLIM/Crop Monitor.
